# Memory Mapped File
Utility for lazy loading of files into memory, reading them through random access and automatic saving if changes were made. It also contains an utility class for using files containing structs/classes and accessing them in a type-safe way. It also contains a facade for LibLzma that hides all its ugly parts in one source file (the source code of LibLzma isn't on GitHub and has to be provided from elsewhere).

More information to be added later.
